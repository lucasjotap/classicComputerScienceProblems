# Classic Computer Science Problems

## Introduction

This project repository contains solutions to several classic computer science projects. These projects cover various fundamental concepts and algorithms commonly encountered in computer science education and practice. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced developer revisiting these timeless challenges, this repository aims to provide clear and concise solutions to help you understand and implement these concepts.

## Projects Included

1. **Sorting Algorithms:**
    - Implementation of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
   
2. **Data Structures:**
    - Implementation of fundamental data structures such as Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Tree, and Graph.

3. **Search Algorithms:**
    - Solutions to classic search algorithms including Linear Search, Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
    - Examples of problems solved using dynamic programming techniques, such as the Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, and Longest Common Subsequence.

5. **Graph Algorithms:**
    - Various algorithms for graph traversal and manipulation, such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path and Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

## Usage

Each project is organized into its own directory, containing the source code files and, where applicable, accompanying documentation or README files explaining the concepts and implementation details.
